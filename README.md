# Caesar Cipher Web Tool

A simple web tool for **encryption** and **decryption** of messages using the **Caesar Cipher** technique. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how basic cryptography concepts can be implemented on the web.

## Features
- **Encrypt and Decrypt** messages with a custom key.
- Easy-to-use interface with input fields for text and key.
- Real-time output of the encrypted or decrypted text.
- Built with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Cryptography Algorithm**: Caesar Cipher

## Usage
1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the text area.
2. Provide a key (between 1 and 25) to shift the alphabet.
3. Click **Encrypt** to encrypt the message, or **Decrypt** to reverse the encryption.
4. View the result displayed below the buttons.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `main.html` in a browser to try the Caesar Cipher Tool.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more cryptography algorithms.
- Improving the UI with animations and better design.
- Adding advanced features like multiple key encryption.
